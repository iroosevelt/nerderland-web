# ðŸ›¸ Nerderland Web

*A social arena floating in space, built by humans for humans*

The main web application for Nerderland - where nerds gather to share stories, build boards, and level up their nerdity.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and welcome to the arena.

## What's Inside

- **Next.js 14** - The React framework for the web
- **Tailwind CSS** - For when you need pixels to behave
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe database queries that just work
- **Wallet Connect** - Web3 authentication made simple
- **Cloudinary** - Image uploads that scale

## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your secrets. You'll need:

- Database connection string
- NextAuth secret (make it random)
- Wallet Connect project ID
- Cloudinary credentials
